# Pascal's Triangle in Python

## Description

This project implements a Python function, `pascal_triangle(n)`, which generates Pascal's Triangle up to the specified row `n`. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients where each element is the sum of the two directly above it. The project includes the function and a test script to display Pascal's Triangle for any number of rows.

## How Pascal's Triangle Works

Pascal's Triangle is a famous mathematical structure. Each row starts and ends with 1, and each interior element is the sum of the two elements directly above it.

For example, Pascal's Triangle for `n = 5` is:

`[1] [1, 1] [1, 2, 1] [1, 3, 3, 1] [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]`
